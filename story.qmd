#  City of Sea and History  
*A port city shaped by the sea, modern history, and quiet charm.*

Historically, it grew as a strategic **trade port**, and today it blends **modern industry, island scenery, and cultural heritage** into a unique landscape.

##  A Port Opened to the World

Gunsan’s history changed significantly when it became an open port in 1899, allowing foreign trade—especially the export of rice from the Honam Plain.  
During the Japanese occupation (1910–1945), the city developed rapidly as Japan built large-scale facilities:

- Gunsan Customs House and old bank buildings in red brick  
- Warehouses and piers used for transporting rice  
- A floating pier that showed advanced engineering at the time  

Today, these places remain part of **Gunsan’s Modern History District**, turning the city into a kind of **“open-air museum” of Korea’s modern era**.
